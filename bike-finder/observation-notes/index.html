	<h1>Bike Shopping with Mimi and Seulgee</h1>
	
	<p>Google: where to buy a bike</p>
	<ul>
	Big Shark >>> St. Louis, one of first results that showed up <em>(location)</em>
	<br />
	Shop BIKES for COMMUTE/URBAN <em>(Applicable for college student in city)</em>
	<br />
	Chose product Schwinn super speed 3 <em>(SCHWINN is a familiar brand for user)</em>
	<br />
	Other options: Red SALE tag, WOMENS bike >>> Disliked purple frame
	</ul>
	
	<p>Google: bike shop online</p>
	<ul>
	Scrolled down and chose PERFORMANCE BIKES website <em>(Not one of top results >>> Other ones had weird names/unnecessary information; user just wanted to know name of bike shop/business)</em>
	<br />
	Many categories to pick from: city/urban, road, mountain, etc. >>> city
	<br />
	Looked at another Schwinn bike, but purple color ugly
	<br />
	Kept separate tab open with Schwinn with yellow bike frame even though was not going to buy it
	</ul>

	<p>When looking at product user scrolls down to read description of product</p> 

	<p>Big Shark: SCHWINN SUPER SPORT 3 ~$250 sale price compared to ~$400 original price; no gender specifications, all-black <em>(Only issue: size SMALL was vague; unclear what that entailed)</em></p>

	<p>Returned to Performance Bikes and also found all-black bike; good reviews, 5-star</p>
	<ul>Look through reviews; one 5-star review mentioned bike as too tall even for someone five-foot-ten <em>(Did not understand number sizing)</em></ul>
	
	<p>Eventually chose Big Shark super sport 3</p>
